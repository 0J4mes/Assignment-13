Preprocesses categorical data into numerical values

Performs exploratory data analysis with visualizations

Generates statistical summaries and cross-tabulations

Saves processed data for downstream machine learning tasks

# Requirements

Python 3.6+

Required packages:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

urllib
